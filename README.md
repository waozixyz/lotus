## Manual

Since this is designed to be used principally on a handheld devices without a window manager, the controls are aimed at d-pad centric. The pattern here is using the B button to handle all window operations, and leave the A button to the applications. Alternatively, you can open a file with `mouse2`.

- `B+Up`, expand a window
- `B+Down`, tab a window
- `B+Right`, open a window
- `B+Left`, close a window

## Editing the theme

Saving the theme, from the tile or theme editor will create a hidden file called [.theme](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/theme.html), which can be opened and edited in [Nasu](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/nasu.html).

## Adding a wallpaper

The wallpaper is an invisible file called `.wallpaper` in the working directory, the file is a [1bpp icn](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/icn_format.html) of the size of the desktop. The wallpaper image can be created with [Noodle](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/noodle.html).
